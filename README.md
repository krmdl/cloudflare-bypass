#Cloudflare Bypass Script
A Python script for bypassing basic Cloudflare protections, developed for scraping, penetration testing, and automated access to resources that implement Cloudflare's anti-bot mechanisms. This script is intended for ethical and legal use onlyâ€”accessing protected resources without permission may violate terms of service and could be illegal.
